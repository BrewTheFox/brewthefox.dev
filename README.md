# brewthefox.dev

- Is the domain that **Gemini** made me buy (I was asking it how to smuggle a fursuit to avoid paying taxes).
- Here I will try to create an amazing introduction website.
- If I'm not able to renew the domain by the next year all my infrastructure will fall for a day or two.
- This is probably not going to be my main portfolio.
